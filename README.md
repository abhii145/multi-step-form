# Multi-Step Form with Conditional Component Rendering

This project is a demonstration of a multi-step form built using React Hook Form for form management and Zod for schema validation. It showcases how to render conditional components based on user input.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Hook Form: A lightweight form management library for React.
- Zod: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

## Features
- Multi-Step Form: The form is divided into multiple steps for user convenience.
- Conditional Rendering: Components are rendered conditionally based on user input, enhancing user experience and form interactivity.
- Schema Validation: Zod is used for schema validation to ensure that user inputs meet defined criteria.
